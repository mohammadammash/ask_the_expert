> Ask The Expert application is a meeting and chatting app built to make answers or ambigious career improvements one question or click away. Ask the Expert app is more than just a meeting application, it gives you the ability to boost your career start from experts close to you until someday you become the expert people want to book with.
>
> The Application would access the location of expert at the moment he/she show as available, and also would access the novice location on home page loads/refresh so it can get back expert within the novice area.

<a id="tech_stack"></a>
<img src="./readme/titles/tech_stack.svg"/>

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Ask The Expert app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native Expo Cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/). Expo is a framework to build React Native apps. It is a set with tools and services built for React Native. It will help you begin with building React Native apps with ease. It provides you with a list of tools that simplify the creation and testing of React Native app.

- For backend [ExpressJS](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used, implementing the model-view-controller design pattern, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) object modeling package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local nonSQL mongo database.

- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [Expo_Notifications_Using_FCM](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/using-fcm/) package which supports all Android apps using Expo SDK.

- To maintain a live chat between users, the app uses the [Firebase_Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) to store users chats and messages.

- To authenticate users, get user id, and check email uniqueness and password match, the app uses [Firebase_Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) before getting the data from MongoDB.
  
- To save or update users profile images, the app use [Firebase_Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage) and saves the profile_url in MongoDB.

- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
